a 0 b x R  found 0 -- so write x and move R
b 0 c 0 R  found a second 0 so we know n > 1 -- write 0 move R
c 0 c 0 R  loop thru all 0s to the L of 11
c 1 d 1 R  found first 1
d 1 e 1 R  found second 1
e 0 e 0 R  loop thru all 0s to the R of 11
e _ f _ L  found _ at end of tape
f 0 g x L  write x at the R end
g 0 g 0 L  loop L
g 1 g 1 L  loop L
g x h x R  found x on L so move R
h 0 i x R  found 0 so change it to x and move R
i 0 i 0 R  loop R
i 1 i 1 R  loop R
i x j x L  found x on the R so now move L
j 0 g x L  found 0 so change it to x and go back to L loop
