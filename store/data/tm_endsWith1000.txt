# accept { x = (0 U 1)* | x ends with 1000 } 
# for example    00011000
# 'start' is the start state
# 'accept' is the accept state
# 'reject' is the reject state
# algorithm is loop all the way to R end
#        then move L checking for a match
# NOTE 1: 'f' could be the accept state
# NOTE 2: this general strategy works for many 'ends with' strings
#   (but would not work with 'ends with '0000' because
#    moving L at extreme L does not actually move L)
