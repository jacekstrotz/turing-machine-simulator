# turing-machine-simulator
A Java program that simulates a Turing Machine, using a versatile proprietary language.

## What is a Turing Machine?
In simple terms, a Turing machine is an abstract mathematical model of computation named after the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing. It's not an actual machine but a theoretical concept that helps us understand the fundamental principles of computation.

## How does it work?
Imagine a tape divided into cells, and each cell can contain a symbol (like 0 or 1). The tape extends infinitely in both directions. The Turing machine has a read/write head that can move left or right along the tape, reading the symbol at the current cell and writing a new symbol.

The machine operates based on a set of rules that define its behavior. These rules specify what action to take (e.g., move left, move right, write a symbol) depending on the current state of the machine and the symbol it reads. The combination of the current state and the symbol under the read/write head determines the next state and the machine's next action.

In essence, a Turing machine follows a set of instructions to manipulate symbols on the tape, and through this process, it can perform any computation that can be algorithmically described.

## How to use this simulator
This simulator allows you to experiment with a simple Turing machine. You can define the machine's initial configuration, set its rules, and observe how it processes input. If you're new to Turing machines, start with the provided examples and gradually explore more complex configurations.

## Defining the language
Each Turing Machine file is written as a series of predefined lines of code:

**Line 1**: The set of states, separated by one space
  ex. a b c d e f g 
  
**Line 2**: The input alphabet
  ex. 0 1 2
  
**Line 3**: The tape alphabet (including the blank character)
  ex. 0 1 2 _
  
**Line 4**: The start state (one)
  ex. a
  
**Line 5**: The accept state (one)
  ex. g
  
**Line 6**: The reject state (one)
  ex. f
  
**Line 7-âˆž**: The Delta function, in the form CURRENT_STATE CURRENT_CHARACTER NEXT_STATE CHARACTER_TO_WRITE DIRECTION
  ex. a 0 a 1 R (if at state 'a', and receive current input index '0', write '1' and travel right one character on input)
  ex. a 1 a 0 L (if at state 'a', and receive current input index '1', write '0' and travel left one character on input)
